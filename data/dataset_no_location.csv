"When these boats of nature's tide, these free sailing sun-kissed branches, come to rest upon either pebbles or golden sands, they sit as kings adoring the seawater view.",beach
"There is a soft song of the marram grasses, the green lullaby that speaks so well to the soul without even a whispered word.",beach
"Then there is the seaweed, that flora of those salty waves, as deeply green as any high summer foliage. My favourite though, of everything that is here upon the softly rolling dunes, is the tall, tall grass that whispers so sweetly into the gusting breeze.",beach
"Upon this primrose sand, the hue as gentle on the eye as a vintage photograph, there is a steady warmth from the grains. Already the stars glow as if they have kept a pocket of the daytime to shine all through the night sky. Sometimes I think the earth and the moon choose to give of their borrowed warmth and light until the return of the sun, the brilliance forever promised at dawn. ",beach
"And in her wake she gives the chance for life, for the rock pools to refill. Those briny waves come as rain to a dessert, a gift never repaid, as it always is with nature... ",beach
"Upon this primrose sand, the hue as gentle on the eye as a vintage photograph, there is a steady warmth from the grains. Already the stars glow as if they have kept a pocket of the daytime to shine all through the night sky. Sometimes I think the earth and the moon choose to give of their borrowed warmth and light until the return of the sun, the brilliance forever promised at dawn. Until then, here I remain, breathing deeply of ocean carried air, listening to the percussion of waves that has been my lullaby since before I was a consciousness wrapped in human form.",beach
"The rain gives of herself unto the ocean, each fragment becoming apart of the body of brine, of the waves and sea-lace. I hear each watery gift, softer than the patter on a rooftop, moving in subtle waves of its own according to the wind. I wonder if this is how music began, how mankind thought to conjure song and dance, by hearing the natural rhythms of nature. Upon the sand, the rain is almost silent, enriching the hue from cream to ears of summer maize.",beach
"With browning legs curled under, dusted with sand like flour on bread, I sit close to the lapping waves. They feel warm and cool, like tea that's been forgotten and returned to. My fingers wiggle in the water, in these lips of the ocean as she sings. ",beach
"The marram grass brought life to the sandy dunes, moving in the wind as so many tiny green flags.",beach
"The coastline was rugged kiss of grey meeting blue, the rocks so in love with those oceanic waves.",beach
"There were the sky towers in the centre, what was once thousands of homes now took up less ground space than an old shopping mall. The rest was parks and wild spaces, a chance to walk among nature or enjoy the trails on bicycles or horseback. Yet perhaps my favourite thing was the river that flowed through the centre, crossing the bridges, pausing just to look at the view I saw every day and loved all the more. ",city
"They built churches, mosques and temples. There were hospitals, libraries, police stations, courts and jails. They made the roads wide and the tower blocks tall. Sometimes in the dark I can still hear the cars and imagine a street so busy I must weave between the people.",city
"Attractions include religious events such as Thanksgiving at the Maeses Center, Halloween in Greenwich Village, free shows at the Central Park in the Summerstage area, seasonal activities such as ice skating in Central  Park and festivals as the Tribeca Film Festival.",city
"Climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, stroll down the Champs Elysées, visit the Louvre, see many shows and exhibitions, or simply wander along the banks of the Seine...read in French in the Tuileries garden, and quite simply take the time to experience the Parisian way of life!",city
"Phosphorus moonlight spilled into the dimly lit room. Behind the doors’ glass insets, a majestic view of the skyline appeared with startling beauty. There wasn’t a cloud in the star-speckled sky. Rows of towering skyscrapers stretched above her, their windows alight from within.",city
"The roads run in their predictable grid pattern and the lights of the stores, restaurants and places of vice shine neon into the night. Everything is out there from homely organic granola to girls that will make you pray in entirely new ways. That's what the metropolis is, the ultimate choice in how you want to live your life.",city
"Lights glittered everywhere just liked stars dropping to the earth, huge and small buildings collided in a mixture of shadow and geometry, tiny vehicles rushing along tangled lines of streets creating twisting threads of light - they all intertwined together in a magnificent mess of dream.",city
"I lifted my head to see out the window; what I saw, took my breath away. The ground below me was alive with lights, like someone had taken a handful of glitter and thrown it as far as the eye could see. It was too dark to make out individual buildings, but the lights were enough for me. I sighed, amazed at the view laid out before me.",city
"There were electric trams, buses and the monorail - hardly any personal vehicles at all. There were days I would look cloud-ward just to see if I could catch a glimpse of the ""architect"" - then I'd feel foolish and stifle a grin.",city
"It is a collection of buildings, roads laid like a carpet for a queen that will never come. Banners hang with slogans to be read only by the dust-laden wind. The market is all set up like it awaits the stall holders any moment. ",city
"The columns were the only complete thing, everything else had worn and crumbled - their decay the only marker if time in a place of uncounted days. Light shone in, illuminating the relics, precious secrets of the forest.",ancient forest
" It is as a duvet that is rumpled in all the right ways, so care free rather than pulled straight. That is the way the grasses are, tufting and waving as the ocean may on some sunny windswept day. I watch the green hues as it deepens and lightens in the sun-rays. The land itself is a steep incline, one that makes one feel the effort of the muscles to climb, yet feel the joy of the effort it takes.",field
"Four hectares of thick spring grass, wet under the early morning dew. Ankle-deep, undulating, thick and tangled as a horse's mane. Steel water trough, lined with green algae, filled with a bucket from the faucet every morning. Wooden fence, post and rail, five bar gate. Beech trees line the fence to the north, overhanging boughs provide dappled shade for the horses in summer, standing flicking flies away with their tails.",field
"Edge of woodland, slopes down gently to bramble filled ditch,ditch overgrown with cow parsley and nettles, bare patches, thick lush dew laden grass, cowslip with it's broad yellow flowers trumpetting the music of spring, Dandelions, Ragwort, scattered clusters of rabbit droppings, hawthorn hedge, five bar gate, brook half chocked with weeds, purple thistle, bumble bee, rutted track, cow pats, clump of figwort.",field
"There is something about the sparkle upon the blue, a melody without a rhythm, music without sound. Above wave the great arms, clothed in the greens of every palate and none, the verdant hues of nature's free dreams. ",forest
"Now that that towers and lingering suburbia is long behind us, those sunny stripes are aged with hairline cracks. The central line is a metal barrier no longer, instead a meter of scrubby grass baked golden is all that separates the east and west bound.",highway
" They are every hue from new spring grass to deep forest pools. Some are more shallow that others, but most have steep paths that take you to one side of their summit and then down to the next valley below. There isn't much to threaten a traveller in these woods, except perhaps the occasional bold bear or wolf pack. For the most part the walk is determined by the walker, it is either relaxing, invigorating, arduous, meditative and every shade in-between.",hill
"In the spring they are clad lightly in the softest greens and they shine in a light that promises them more warmth to come. By summer they are in their thickest coat, deep rich greens to absorb the intense rays and provide cool shelter to any creatures that pass. By fall they are scarlets and golds, more beautiful than our emperors exquisite gowns. Their leaves tumble to the undergrowth, blanketing the ground with their brilliant hues and letting shafts of white penetrate the canopy once more. But now it is winter and the naked trees shiver in the bitter blasts.",hill
"They are clothed in scrubby grass too poor to even put flesh on a goat. On the tops the wintry wind is fierce and bitter, in the valleys it is more still and the sunshine has real warmth. The pale brown path that was rutted by horses in the soggy fall is now frozen and hard enough to twist an ankle. In each depression is a small frozen puddle and so for now it is simpler to just walk your own path over the frost-stiffened grass.",hill
The paths that were illuminated just hours before become lost in a blackness that even moonlight cannot help. The trees that are magnificent in sunshine tower over James as he steps across the borderline between the seen and unseen.,hill
"Gently undulating, steep, grassy knoll, rocky scree slope, springy turf of moss and grass, wooded, pasture, broken up with hedgerows like a great patchwork quilt, grazed by sheep.",hill
"The sun set threatening to dip behind the horizon, firstly cascading a prim bombardment of colours that were flung over the sky with terrible alacrity. The receding blue and oranges battled the blackness pushing it away with arms.",lake
"To the chorus of birdsong from the surrounding green bushes, and the sound of carp sucking amongst the flowering lily-pads, mother duck, watchful for the predatory pike, scooped the surface for food, with her young trailing behind like a row of bobbing corks.",lake
"A deep sense of serenity overcame her as she stared in rapture at the expanse of blue that lay before her. Rays of lights danced delicately across the water, birthed from the afternoon sun that both limited her sight and made the view all the more beautiful.",lake
"The water is movie-star blue – the kind of blue their eyes are. In it the wisps of clouds are reflected just as well as the steep sides of the glacial valley, all greens and greys.",lake
"When the skyscrapers were being built I thought they would block out the sun, make downtown dingy and overcast, but I was wrong. They were nothing like the concrete towers that were thrown up in the 1980's that looked derelict almost as soon as the shovels were taken out of the ground. ",modern building
"The skyscraper was old and deserted, it stood like a tombstone amongst the broken wooden shacks around it. When it was built it was to be the first of many, the centre of a new downtown core. That was before the virus, back when we still had industry and commerce.",modern building
The windows of the skyscraper started down at them like a many-eyed monster. The doorway that should have been lit was was strangely dark and it gaped like an open mouth.,modern building
"...a cluster of four high tech buildings...The buildings were large, smoked glass and steel, each one joined to the next by a covered walkway.",modern building
"The house looked like a cut out from Architects Today magazine. It was beautiful. but not in the olde-worlde quaint kind of way I was usually drawn to. Everything was geometric, which I guess you could say about almost any pitched roof abode with square windows, but on this house you couldn't help but notice it.",modern building
"The buildings galloped up the clouds and they had entire floors dedicated to play. There were slides to go down several floors at a time, they had elevators too but fun was thought so important that those were added too. ",modern building
"Rock arose from the ground as if it reached for the sky, peaks of the Alps sculpted by the raindrops of eons. They were green at their base, the forests gathered by nature's wand. Then there were the roads that climbed the Alps, wending this way and that, making tight turns that felt for all the world as a fair ground ride.",mountain
"Their white-winter coats are gaily swapped for deepest green and the ground-snow remains as glacial rivers for a time. A few more weeks and there will be rocks showing from the white, then the earth below. This is the time when the streams run full, when their life is infused with fresh water, pure and clean. ",mountain
"To my eye, their peaks are the green line of a doctor's graph. I saw those rocks at dawn, those slopes that give home to so much life, a foundation for trees and shrubs, grass and ferns. ",mountain
"There is nothing that can make me feel so elevated and yet so insignificant as the Alps. They rise like mighty jagged teeth from the earth, creviced to perfection, sculpted by the rains and winters. The track up and over is not as a child might imagine, winding round as the tinsel goes around a christmas tree, but folds back and forth in hairpin turns. The summer breeze down here at the base will be a winter chill up there, the alpine grass giving way to snow and ice...",mountain
"Her eyes began to water as a wind whipped the hair across her face. When she looked down at the dizzying drop, nothing met her gaze but flat clouds, hiding the treasure of their landscape below.",mountain
"The flat land surrounding them meant all could be seen for miles around, the rising moon casting a wash of cool, pale blue over everything. Oranges and purples filled the air, the clouds framed with silver and gold from the sun and moon who shared the sky for these short moments. ",mountain
"Their white-winter coats are gaily swapped for deepest green and the ground-snow remains as glacial rivers for a time. A few more weeks and there will be rocks showing from the white, then the earth below. This is the time when the streams run full, when their life is infused with fresh water, pure and clean.",mountain
"At the far end of a long gravelled driveway, and surrounded by well manicured lawns, the chalet-style bungalow nestled in a pocket of light, semi-woodland.",road
"It is a grey that has welcomed many suns, become silvery as it soaked in the rays. I let my eyes run over each hue, seeing imperfections for the first time, yet feeling that as details created by an artistic hand, they render it all the more beautiful.",road
"As the sun sets, its rising is already promised to the land, to the green shoots who wait in faith. And so, even though our eyes may only see one step at a time, we stride on, eyes wide. ",road
All about us was the perfume of the salty water and the fine spray that came as boldly as any viola flurry. It was as if life herself had entered the water and the energy was so great that this great pulse came upward to form a steady rhythm.,sea
"In them are schools of the living, the creation that remained in her watery embrace when we land dwellers sought flowers and the shelter of trees. Though to her fish swimming is as easy as breathing underwater, it is no doubt time for me to return to the waves and the boat that awaits, anchored for my return as it rests upon her steady pulse.",sea
"The waves come in as a deep aquamarine and turn golden as they churn the sand on the shore. Each hue is made more pretty by the brilliant white of the crests, drawing the eye away from the cloudless sky.",sea
