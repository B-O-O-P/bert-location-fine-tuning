"Light shone through the wintry branches, shadowy arms stretching across the ancient ruins. What was left stood in spite of itself, defying gravity in its precarious way. Yet, this place, kept secret by the trees, was safe. It had avoided modern man's destructive touch and so had become a sanctuary for the animals.",ancient ruins
"The columns were the only complete thing, everything else had worn and crumbled - their decay the only marker if time in a place of uncounted days. Light shone in, illuminating the relics, precious secrets of the forest.",ancient ruins
"Pre-Columbian civilisations firmly left their mark on Mexico’s great lands; the entire country is scattered with ancient ruins and archaeological wonders as well as charmingly, colourful towns left behind by colonialists and beautifully preserved by locals today. ",ancient ruins
"Uxmal and its giant Pyramid of the Magician appears out of harsh jungle landscape with its height and unique, smooth-curved design (unlike most Mayan buildings in Mexico) make it one of the ancient Mayan’s most unique structures. Located more inland than other sites, it is still, according to some, one of the most important ancient ruins in Mexico.",ancient ruins
"When picturing ancient ruins, the Middle East naturally comes to mind. With grand temples like the Pyramids of Egypt, lost cities and civilizations that date back to the dawn of time, you can never leave the Middle East of an Ancient itinerary.",ancient ruins
These premiere ancient ruins in Turkey are set in the middle of the most beautiful and unique landscape you will ever encounter.Caves and churches have been carved into the landscape with complete underground cities to explore.,ancient ruins
"It took us a while to finally see Rome and wow, what a city. Ancient ruins are intertwined throughout the entire metropolis.One minute you are sipping an espresso in a cafe and the next you are walking by a piece of architecture thousands of years old.",ancient ruins
All I could think of was the Musical A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum when I looked upon the Ancient Ruins. But then I quickly forgot everything I was thinking because it simply took my breath away. I love how the city of Rome built around their history instead of mowing it down like so many cities here in Canada. The ruins and archeological sites are what make a visit to Rome so special.,ancient ruins
"It's fascinating traveling through Ireland to see ruins and tombs that are ancient. I used to think they were only in places like Egypt and Rome.  Newgrange is so perfectly intact, it's hard to believe it could last so long, but then again, it is made up of 200,000 tons of rocks!",ancient ruins
"Chichen Itza is probably the most visited by tourists from Canada and the US, but it was one of our favorites. It was the first ancient ruin we ever visited making it the most memorable. Located in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico about 3 hours from Cancun, we had our most in-depth tour of any temple that we have ever gone to.",ancient ruins
"The coast for fifty miles west of Bognor was full of pleats and tucks - harbors, channels, inlets and Southampton Water, and the bays of Spithead.",bay

"This archipelago stretches out along the south of Florida and offers stunning white-sand beaches lined with palm trees prime ocean real estate. Visit nearby Key Biscayne, the northernmost island located just 15 minutes from town, for some great waterfront parks, a scenic bike path, beautiful views of Miami, and some swimming spots.",beach
"The water was a little too cold for me in February, but that didn’t stop a lot of people from swimming. Miami Beach is also the place to spot highly attractive people running along the beach, if you don’t mind being a bit of a voyeur.",beach
"The lush wilderness of the Waipi’o Valley (Big Island) was once home to Hawaiian kings. Today, it’s scattered with taro fields. Waipi’o is named for the river that cuts between the valley walls, giving way to waterfalls until eventually flowing into the ocean at a black sand beach.",beach
"There are many trails here, but the main hike down into the valley will take you to the black sand beach and back up again. It’s 6.5 miles (10km) and strenuous but worth it. ",beach
"At the Kaanapali Luau, there’s a traditional Hawaiian dance ceremony, a Samoan fire knife dance, and a traditional Hawaiian buffet — most of which is cooked in an underground oven. You’ll have a sunset backdrop on the beach throughout the whole thing too. ",beach
"It’s hard to find a bad beach to hang out on in Hawaii. Most of them have powder-white sands, swaying palm trees, and epic sunsets. ",beach
"The island is a 45-minute ferry from Maui and is home to beautiful beaches, scenic nature trails (Munro and Naha are two popular trails), and a couple of golf courses. ",beach
"You can also find private campgrounds for around $25 USD per person all over the islands. Some people recommend wild camping on beaches for free, but this isn’t actually allowed in most places due to the delicate environment. Plus, it’s too easy to wander onto sacred grounds, which is a big no-no.",beach
"fter spending time there, I can say that I MUCH preferred Lahaina as a place – it’s cute, with lots of character, right on the waterfront, and has the majority of the nightlife. Kanapa’ali is mostly resorts and a shopping centre (Whaler’s Village) and has little character, but it has great beaches, so I was happy we did it the way we did as it was nice to be able to just stroll to the beach and it was easier enough to get taxis in the evenings.",beach
"My favourite stop on the Road to Hana was Wai’anapanapa State Park, where we swam in the water off the black sand beach. I would definitely suggest that you bring water shoes for this as the pebbles hurt your feet and are difficult to walk on.",beach
"The sand is the most gentle hue of gold, almost earthen and muted, the humble star of the scene. I love this beach. I love the driftwood that comes upon the buoyant waves as tiny rescue boats. Then there is the seaweed, that flora of those salty waves, as deeply green as any high summer foliage. My favourite though, of everything that is here upon the softly rolling dunes, is the tall, tall grass that whispers so sweetly into the gusting breeze.",beach
"The cool water laps at my feet, fizzing and bubbling like brine. Even though the sun is beating on my back, beaming in my eyes, I can't help but smile as the wind caresses my face. Waves ahead roar and roll down, crashing onto the shore with a soft hiss; peeling away at the deep bronze sand beneath my feet. Without hesitation, I plunge into the blue-green water, my board pressed up against my chest. A chill surges through me, but a small wave washes it away.",beach
"The beach stretched out alongside the water, these constant friends chattering as the water comes in her reassuring way, as if her joy is to soothe the sand. And in her wake she gives the chance for life, for the rock pools to refill. Those briny waves come as rain to a dessert, a gift never repaid, as it always is with nature... the strong give, life thrives... and so it goes on.",beach
"Upon this primrose sand, the hue as gentle on the eye as a vintage photograph, there is a steady warmth from the grains. Already the stars glow as if they have kept a pocket of the daytime to shine all through the night sky. Sometimes I think the earth and the moon choose to give of their borrowed warmth and light until the return of the sun, the brilliance forever promised at dawn. ",beach
"There was the dazzling blue of the ocean, the immaculate white beaches, the rich, elemental green of the pine trees and rain forest.",beach
The beach was such a shallow incline that even a child could wade out five hundred yards of more and still the water would be below their knees. In places a sand bar would raise them so high that from the shore they appeared to be walking on the water itself. ,beach
" At this beach a gale meant impudent swelling waves that thrashed but were as threatening as a watch dog on a short chain. So come rain, shine or near hurricane, this is where my grandfather walked everyday of his retirement, with his nutty ridgeback dog tearing in and out of the brine.",beach
"The waves were wild horses, rearing up before crashing down onto the beach, pounding the sand with their white foam hooves.",beach
" The changing feel as you move through the city’s neighborhoods – Harlem, the Upper East Side, Soho, Chinatown, Greenwich Village, Little Italy and the Meatpacking District – makes it feel like visiting lots of different cities in one. And that’s before you get out of Manhattan and start exploring the city’s other boroughs.",city
"NYC, a city forever in flux, is impossible to “see” in one visit. You just have to resign yourself to that fact, unless you move here (and maybe not even then), you’ll only barely scratch the surface! By the time you leave, new places will have cropped up. This city is home to thousands of restaurants, hundreds of museums, attractions, plays, and quirky things to do. Last weekend, I was walking down the street and stumbled into a (delicious) Japanese food festival. It was just there! You never know what you will find in NYC.",city
"Start your trip off with a walking tour. The city is home to dozens of walking tour companies (many of them FREE) offering tours on every genre possible. If you like it, chances are there is a tour revolving around it. Be sure to take one of the many, many walking tours the city has to offer to get a unique and cultural look at the city that never sleeps from a local guide. I always take my friends on at least one when they visit.",city
"New York City is a big place with a lot to do and this list barely scratches the surface. Four days is barely enough to squeeze these activities in, let alone find time to visit boroughs like Queens and Brooklyn. If you have the time, I recommend staying for at least five days. But if you’re pressed for time, following these tips will give you four days full of fun and excitement in the city that never sleeps.",city
"Over the years, this site has evolved into a New York City lifestyle and travel blog and less about my life (as it was in the first year or so), offering posts about living, food, culture, travel, and more to readers around the world. I strive to provide one of the best sources for people who are curious to learn more about New York, think they may want to make the leap and live here, visit regularly, or may never visit but continue to be infatuated with the city, the people and the lifestyle.",city
"We even got to go up at night, it’s a whole different experience, but you have to do both! Yes it’s colder, and probably just as busy, but this is when you see properly the city that never sleeps. So many different colours run through the city, and this is when I realised how bright Times Square actually is with all its billboards since it stills blinds you from the top of The Empire State!",city
"This was our last afternoon in New York, so we decided to do probably the most iconic thing in the city, Times Square (again), it’s just amazing it’s something you see all the time on TV so we just had to finish off the trip with that. And to top it off it was full of Halloween decorations, literally pumpkins EVERYWHERE, and what was brilliant about it was that the pumpkins were free to take for the public, it was to make sure that the whole city was decorated which I think is the most amazing idea, literally brings the whole city together.",city
"There are some incredibly useful London travel blogs out there which will make planning your trip to the capital easier than anything.

"You can also use the Paris l’Open Tour (tour buses) which cover four routes across the capital all day with commentary in 8 languages. From 9.30 am to 6.30 pm they travel between many stops, picking up and dropping off every 10 to 25 minutes.",city
I want the city. A place where the sky twinkles at night with the man made light that guides my path. A place that never allows the deafening silence to enter into my mind. A place where constant motion forbids me to wallow in self pity. A place that has a million faces I will never know. ,city
"The city air is fresh this day, almost sweet and floral as the pace of living relaxes to a steadier rhythm.",city
"The city raged with a destructive silence, bursting my delicate ear drums.",city
"They were from places like India and Arabia, their cities bright with 1000 lights. They'd travelled days just to be there for hours.",city
"The city loves me in ways no person ever has. It listens to my fierce footsteps, the clicking of my polished heels against it's dirty pavements early on a Monday morning. ",city
"Before the virus the city was always moving; cars, people, busses, trains. All those people making the organic part of the city, the part that determined the character and the structures. Those people dreamed of stadiums and theatres, they built ice-rinks and laid out parks with soccer pitches. They built churches, mosques and temples. There were hospitals, libraries, police stations, courts and jails.",city
"The city was always quieter at night though, perhaps that's another reason I prefer the night. But even then there were lights everywhere, from cars, restaurants, apartments and late-night shops.",city
"This was alway a city of the haves and have-nots. There were those in West-Van with their exotic cars and luxury life style and those on Hastings Street, drug addled and abused. Of course there was a huge middle class that was neither. Working all their waking hours to give their kids ski lessons, music lessons, two sports clubs and foreign vacations.",city
"The city was simply urban, just like he’d imagined - tall buildings in an exact grid pattern. Ubiquitous skyscrapers were smudged by the smog-filled sky, no sunlight, no birds. Cars raced between red traffic lights, stubbornly flickering in the grey.",city
" The city was ghostly for those frozen weeks, no-one moved for fear of contracting the virus. Then hunger took over and the looting began. Cowering behind locked doors saved no-one, eventually it found a way in under the door or down the chimney. ",city
"The city changes every few minutes on the journey home; the downtown flicking between affluence and poverty. There are streets of up-market stores, smooth black and glass exteriors, fancy names in fancier lettering.",city
"An entire city custom constructed for the third millennium. Everything the body wanted, and nothing the soul needed. Three hundred square miles of gray steel and automobiles.",city
"Satellite city. A supercity of twenty-five million souls, each one with a story more heartbreaking than the last. If it's happy-ever-afters you want, stay away from the city of the future.",city
"The city was a vast, intricate, labyrinth of noisy, streets and alleys. You could hear the incessant honking of the vehicles even before the sun rose. Impatient businessmen who had to get to the office, mothers who had to leave their children at their schools, facing the puzzling challenge of navigating through the crowd of parents and children; even some of the teachers who had stopped at the local bakery to get a bagel or two before their morning classes.",city
"Unprosperous inner city suburb, low rise terrace containing amorphous mixture of run down stores and those renovated with newer signs, concrete high rise tower block set back from the road, graffiti on a concrete wall, betting shops, take-aways, small grocery store. ",city
"The cityscape was unapologetically urban. There were no trees or city planted blooms, just monoliths of concrete soaring out of the sidewalk in an exact grid pattern. At night it was beautiful in it's own way, so many lights. By day you relied on the sky to let you know that it wasn't a monochromatic world; just one in which the people were too busy for art.",city
" In this city we only work and eat, there is no time to sweep fall leaves or plant spring flowers, hardly even enough to notice the blue above. With no more designers our clothing and cars never change, there are five styles of everything in white through grey. You pick the best one for you and use it until it falls apart before returning it for a replacement. In this way our city outperforms those in the region.",city
"The city is a living machine spread over once green land like a microchip grossly enlarged. The roads run in their predictable grid pattern and the lights of the stores, restaurants and places of vice shine neon into the night. Everything is out there from homely organic granola to girls that will make you pray in entirely new ways. That's what the metropolis is, the ultimate choice in how you want to live your life.",city
"The city spread below me, and the world suddenly felt so wide and free that I wanted to jump. Lights glittered everywhere just liked stars dropping to the earth, huge and small buildings collided in a mixture of shadow and geometry, tiny vehicles rushing along tangled lines of streets creating twisting threads of light - they all intertwined together in a magnificent mess of dream. A breathtaking, marvellous, almost frightened dream that made me feel like some fake, unlucky living thing.",city
"The cityscape was a jumble of shapes, like a child had cast blocks down randomly and then swept them so close together they touched. There were rectangles, domes and mini-castles. There were spires, weather vanes and satellite dishes. Between the dwellings and businesses the roads were so narrow that they frequently became blocked by trucks brining in wares. These juggernauts were designed for highways and the metropolis, not ancient walled cities with bridges designed for the horse and cart. ",city
"The city of Wardshaven spread in front of them, white buildings rising from the wide spaces of green treetops, under a shimmer of sun-reflecting aircars above.",city
"The city was scrubbed every nightfall by the machines, wilting plants replaced and litter removed. In that way the cityscape stayed new, like an architects plan, only with the citizens really living inside. There were electric trams, buses and the monorail - hardly any personal vehicles at all.",city
"The cityscape from the top of the cathedral was a mess, roads looping and weaving with less organisation than a natural river. Once it had been a town, but its proximity to the river and easy land connections made it a hub of trade. Unlike the newer cities it grew organically, roads twisting, houses of all shapes and sizes. There were no blocks, no grid pattern, you either knew the place or carried a GPS.",city
"They were from places like India and Arabia, their cities bright with 1000 lights. They'd travelled days just to be there for hours.",city
"Every city had its own flavour, but always the harried commuters ruled the daytime hours. To get to know the city for real, to find out what lay beneath the tourist veneer, Ian had to go out at night. ",city
"The cities passed in a blur of concrete and steel, everywhere the mantra was the same, everywhere the depression was as thick. The same music played from the stores, the same food was served in mean portions, the only smiles worn by the corporate drones who put them like identity badges.",city
"It was as if God had stopped time, removed all the distractions so he could see it for real, see how it really was, what it really was. And in that moment all he wished for was another beating heart in this deserted city, another being of warm blood and flesh, one more pair of boots to walk next to his.",city
"The city is as it was before, just devoid of the warmth that made it worthy of that term. It is a collection of buildings, roads laid like a carpet for a queen that will never come. Banners hang with slogans to be read only by the dust-laden wind. The market is all set up like it awaits the stall holders any moment. ",city
"The buildings stand in defiance of the people who fell. They are no vulnerable flesh but concrete and steel, not as timeless as the mountains that ring the city but able to outlast the civilization that created them by centuries. Given enough time even the smooth grey will give way to a jungle of green and this “ancient” civilization will lay ruined for future generations to discover and perhaps piece together how we lived.",city
" Our city is mostly abandoned, the buildings are shells, no longer receiving power and running water. Some of us stay, stick it out farming the gardens left behind. Parents actually raise their kids, teenagers are more like adults than they ever were, adults have less mid-life problems. It's like we had to loose the world to get grounded in what the humans need: family, love, togetherness and God.",city
"In the fog the city is blurred like an old painting; it could be a great work drawn by expert hand. The buildings and the Japanese cherry trees are silhouetted black, two-dimensional. The streets yawn in every direction without only the old newspaper dispensers and street-lamps to break the view between buildings so high that the tops disappear in the swirling white. It doesn't smell right at all, in fact it smells of nothing but the damp trees not yet in bloom.",city
"When these city streets hummed we have everything except our freedom and we liked it that way. We had the toys and the gadgets, the labour saving devices and minimum wage workers to care for our children. We had designer clothes and designer coffee, we had the media to tell us everything we ever needed to know. It was so simple to know how to think and act.",city
"The city planted saplings have exploded in their pots, given more time they will either break their man-made prisons or die, root bound and weak. The wind passes almost unhindered, passing down the streets faster than a freight train and howling just the same. In the plaza there are still the fashionable store signs for coffee shops and delis. How decadent life had become to offset the awfulness our stressful work-lives. ",city
"The city is perfect. There is no dirt, no cars, no people. From the air it is identical to the architects table, skyscrapers on a grid pattern. There are shopping malls and business parks, an air-strip and city hall. Right after the concrete dried the first people came in a wave of excitement. It was a new city, purpose built, not something that had grown haphazardly from a village to a town to a sprawling metropolis.",city
"Egypt and its ancient culture throughout the Nile has captivated and amazed travelers for centuries. From the sand-covered tombs of lost civilizations to the dusty barren desert of the Sahara, Egypt will bring out the adventurer in all of us. ",desert
"Such scenarios included an armed plain-clothed security guard in our car when driving all-around Alexandria and a six-manned police truck escorting us out of a quiet desert area after visiting a well-known monastery. Like any destinations, some neighbourhoods are safer than others. ",desert
"Covering most of Northern Africa – 3.6 million square miles – the Sahara Desert is the third largest desert on the planet and the largest hot desert. While many people often think of the gorgeous sand dunes that are found in the Sahara, they only comprise a small portion. The landscape is primarily made of rocky hamada, or barren land with rocky plateaus. You’ll also find small patches of grassland (albeit sparse), shrubs of the desert variety, mountains, and salt flats.",desert
"The desert is an incredibly harsh environment with lows going well below zero degrees in the winter, and water sources are almost nonexistent, making the area almost devoid of flora and fauna. Even those on the Silk Road tried to avoid the area by traveling on the fringes of the desert.",desert
" The most populated desert on the planet, the Thar Desert is home to 83 people per square kilometer. The landscape is identifiable by large shifting sand dunes, which cover most of the desert, along with alluvial plains and salt lakes that appear during monsoon season.

"The Sahara desert has a variety of land features, but is most famous for the sand dune fields that are often depicted in movies. The dunes can reach almost 600 feet (183 meters) high but they cover only about 15 percent.

"Four hectares of thick spring grass, wet under the early morning dew. Ankle-deep, undulating, thick and tangled as a horse's mane. Steel water trough, lined with green algae, filled with a bucket from the faucet every morning. Wooden fence, post and rail, five bar gate. Beech trees line the fence to the north, overhanging boughs provide dappled shade for the horses in summer, standing flicking flies away with their tails.",field
"The field rises in a way that brings a newly departed bed to my thoughts. It is as a duvet that is rumpled in all the right ways, so care free rather than pulled straight. That is the way the grasses are, tufting and waving as the ocean may on some sunny windswept day. I watch the green hues as it deepens and lightens in the sun-rays. The land itself is a steep incline, one that makes one feel the effort of the muscles to climb, yet feel the joy of the effort it takes.",field
"Earth soft and crumbly, ridges and furrows, scattering of weeds, mayweed, dandelion, wild mustard, fumewort, field sandbur, scent of cow dung, pebbles.",field
"The grass is taller than I've ever seen it; meadow-like but still green. All that's missing is the weeds that were so beautiful in the somerset fields. I want the blue cornflowers, scarlet poppies, white asters and even the thistles.",field
"These fields are the fields of home. Perhaps I had to go far away to appreciate it, but never again. I see its everyday beauty for the wonder it is and know this is where am most at peace.",field
"These fields are the fields of home. Perhaps I had to go far away to appreciate it, but never again. I see its everyday beauty for the wonder it is and know this is where am most at peace.

"The gold fields of our district work like a sedative for the citizens. They mean the harvest is in, the grain silos are full, the animals will be fed and so will your families. The stress melts out of the air and is replaced by preparations for the harvest carnival",field
"The late summer fields stretched lazily across the billowing hills, a beautiful patchwork of gold stubble and green pasture. Those golden squares, glowing in the dying summer sun, were a blessing and a curse to the children of the village.",field

"Made inconspicuous by the residential colonies and marketplaces surrounding it, Jahanpanah forest is often left ignored even by locals.

"In this forest I am with my tribe of wood and leaf, among the giants who's roots hug the earth. It is a place of ancient souls, of the creatures who dwell with the sweet sounds of moving water and bird song. Somehow this is more home than home, perhaps one day I'll learn why.",forest
"Perhaps it would be a fitting tribute to the life work of Sir David Attenborough, as well as a much needed step to save our own souls, to ban the sale of all furniture made from new wood. Such a step would be positive shift in the economy and the way we live. Jobs in refurbishment and the antique industry would flourish - we'd gain more carpenters and artists who can work from home.",forest
"It is to the forest I go for rest, for serenity that flows as cool river waters. There is something about the sparkle upon the blue, a melody without a rhythm, music without sound. Above wave the great arms, clothed in the greens of every palate and none, the verdant hues of nature's free dreams.",forest
"In the forest I breathe in every way that it is possible to expand: in lungs, in brain in soul. In the forest there is a sense of kinship with the flora, of an ancient soul that stretches into everything that lives. It is here under the nascent rays of a sun born to rise each day that I am so very alive. ",forest
"And upon the forest floor so woven with ancient tree roots came a light filtered by the bouquet of foliage above: softened, verdant and freshly aromatic.",forest
"The forest is the orchestra of my mind, playing one enchanting symphony after another. Her leaves dance to an unheard beat, whispering their songs to the wind. In here, sheltered by the mighty trees, is every kind of life, from the humble beetle to enchanting birds of every colour. I hold my hands up to feel the cascading light, a brilliant white shaft illuminating the path that takes me onward and home.",forest

"In this old growth forest the trees rise upward forever, the canopy above is distant, like clouds of green. Even with arms out-stretched I would never even be able to reach even a fraction of the way around their gnarly bark trunks. Stepping carefully over the roots that knot the pathway, watching the freshly fallen rain seep into the soil, I am struck by a wish to melt in with it. ",forest

"I found these roads so different when I first came to Canada. They scared me with their two or three lanes in both directions - and it’s just a regular road really. A decade ago a lot of them didn't even have ""cats eyes,"" combine that with no streetlights and heavy rain in the dead of night and no-one slowing down...",highway
"In the city the highway was black and fresh, yellow paint as perfect as a child's picture book. Now that that towers and lingering suburbia is long behind us, those sunny stripes are aged with hairline cracks. The central line is a metal barrier no longer, instead a meter of scrubby grass baked golden is all that separates the east and west bound. The tyres bring a monotony as they sail over the weary grey beneath and the only thing to knock a driver from their stupor is a passing vehicle or a radio cranked to the max.",highway
"The tires make their monotonous hiss over the rain-washed highway and the air that makes its way though the filters is meadow-sweet. All around, through these tinted windows are fields. ",highway

"The barn blossomed on the hill amid the grass and the meadow flowers, as if one day it sprung up from some precious seed. I guess what I'm saying is, it belonged there, and if it were absent the picture of that landscape would be missing something very special. ",hill
"The hills are a patchwork of green made even more varied by the shadows of passing clouds. They are every hue from new spring grass to deep forest pools. Some are more shallow that others, but most have steep paths that take you to one side of their summit and then down to the next valley below. There isn't much to threaten a traveller in these woods, except perhaps the occasional bold bear or wolf pack. For the most part the walk is determined by the walker, it is either relaxing, invigorating, arduous, meditative and every shade in-between.",hill
"The hills change their clothes with the season just like the fashion conscious city folk. In the spring they are clad lightly in the softest greens and they shine in a light that promises them more warmth to come. By summer they are in their thickest coat, deep rich greens to absorb the intense rays and provide cool shelter to any creatures that pass. By fall they are scarlets and golds, more beautiful than our emperors exquisite gowns. ",hill
"The hills are little more than a layer of poor soil over rock. They are clothed in scrubby grass too poor to even put flesh on a goat. On the tops the wintry wind is fierce and bitter, in the valleys it is more still and the sunshine has real warmth. The pale brown path that was rutted by horses in the soggy fall is now frozen and hard enough to twist an ankle. In each depression is a small frozen puddle and so for now it is simpler to just walk your own path over the frost-stiffened grass. ",hill
The hills that lie friendly in the day - like the pillows of the land - are darkly ominous by night. The paths that were illuminated just hours before become lost in a blackness that even moonlight cannot help. The trees that are magnificent in sunshine tower over James as he steps across the borderline between the seen and unseen.,hill
"The hills didn't much care for the doings of men. They had seen dominant species come and go before. But now they shook with the blast of TNT as the newcomers searched for minerals that would make them rich. The diversity of the delicate flora and fauna meant nothing to them, the pursuit of a shiny yellow metal meant everything, The sprits hadn't stirred for time out of mind but now they began to rouse from rock, soil and tree.",hill
"The hills themselves were under threat and that could not be allowed to pass. The spirits convened and found their powers insufficient, so they called on their darker brethren to bring pain to the humans.",hill
"The hills rolled like waves of an angry ocean before them and under the blanket of trees lay rocky escarpments and steep gorges. Their foothills overlapped making the valley river wend around them and the sky was dark and low giving a claustrophobic feel. The party had no choice but to cross them, there was no other way to the gates. Whatever lurked under the dense canopy of green would have to be faced, each took a dagger from their thigh hilt and stepped into the damp shade without a word.",hill
"The hill was a broad knoll with a flat rocky top, to one side the escarpment fell away sharply, to the other it rolled away, gently undulant with tussocks. The grass grew thick and coarse, but was kept short by the sheep that grazed there.",hill

"Rock arose from the ground as if it reached for the sky, peaks of the Alps sculpted by the raindrops of eons. They were green at their base, the forests gathered by nature's wand. Then there were the roads that climbed the Alps, wending this way and that, making tight turns that felt for all the world as a fair ground ride.",mountain

"There is nothing that can make me feel so elevated and yet so insignificant as the Alps. They rise like mighty jagged teeth from the earth, creviced to perfection, sculpted by the rains and winters.

The summer breeze down here at the base will be a winter chill up there, the alpine grass giving way to snow and ice...",mountain
"The mountains rose up before them in the west, haloed in the aureate light of the setting sun.

"There were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of beech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit of the Col and then dropped down...We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams.",mountain
"The mountains clustered together like they were cold, and under all that snow I don't doubt they were. I imagined them to shiver under their white coats, the real cause of the avalanches perhaps. Perhaps in that rock they think in the way timeless creatures must, with no regard for time, no concept of what it must be to hurry, be anxious or sad. I'd like to think that deep in the tonnes of granite is a spirit of the earth, slumbering since the time of the dinosaurs or before. At this point I can't tell which of them the road will take me to, it disappears in the forest only fifty meters or so ahead. I only hope that it passes though a valley between two of them rather than having to scale a peak.",mountain

"The mountains were covered with a rug of trees, green, yellow, scarlet and orange, but their bare tops were scarfed and beribboned with snow. From carved rocky outcrops, waterfalls drifted like skeins of white lawn, and in the fields we could see the amber glint of rivers and the occasional mirror-like flash of a mountain lake",mountain
"She stood atop the rocky surface and raised her arms in victory. Clouds swirled around her in an icy greeting and snow coated the mountain top.

"The mountain rose into the blue, a craggy grey face more steep than any David had ever seen. He lifted his eyes to the sky, touched his fingers to his lips and offered a kiss heaven-bound. This mountain was just the same as all of the others, just one boot hold, one hand hold at a time - no more, no less. He wrapped his fingers around the first cold rocky outcrop, his fingers making firm contact.",mountain
"The track snaked around the side of a mountain with a sheer drop to the right. He was somewhere in the Brecon Beacons and there should have been a view, but it had been wiped out by the rain and the fading light. A few trees twisted out of the side of the hill with leaves as hard as thorns. ",mountain
"When the melt comes to the mountains, it is the evergreens who show the season change first. Their white-winter coats are gaily swapped for deepest green and the ground-snow remains as glacial rivers for a time.

This is the time when the streams run full, when their life is infused with fresh water, pure and clean.",mountain

"The mountain peak had a bluish hue; Ian touched it with his gloved had to lay the black against it. Unless it was a trick of the bright sky above, the rock had a forget-me-not hue. Removing his eye-wear he scanned the ground for a sample. He could photograph it for sure but wouldn't it be so much nice to have a rock for the mantle. ",mountain
"The mountain rose on the horizon, sheer rock striking down from snowy peak. Only the base was softened by the virescence of a pine blanket. An hour ago it had seemed so close, and now after flying down the highway at a hundred kilometres an hour it was just the same size. ",mountain
"The mountain path ahead was loose rock, each one washed smooth by the river that once ran freely over them. Jack braced his feet, attempting to guard against the inevitable rolling in random directions, but his ankles tumbled left and right regardless. Thickly dark green boughs arched over the path from each side, competing for the light. ",mountain
"It was easy to see the mountain as just its peak, but in truth the land was rising around it for a long way before it became a rocky projection into the sky-line.

As the years grew on the mountain had many of its kind grow around him.",mountain

Tendrils of iridescent silver mist creep over the mountainside. Harsh wind whips and screams through the cold air. The sky is still dark -- rough oily midnight blue. No sunlight.,mountain

"The mountain path winds ahead as effortlessly as a blanket laid on a bed, yet each footfall costs Ian more strength. It is as steep as it is narrow and rocky in a chaotic way, just enough to stop his gait falling into a steady rhythm.",mountain
"Her eyes traced the line of the horizon and paused on the broad mountains towering above it. The jagged peaks of the snow-capped mountains caused a stirring in her soul. A thirst for adventure and beauty awakened in her heart and flowed out into the tips of her toes, making her want to run straight into the embrace of the proud mountains.",mountain

It had been so many years since the age of the car that they had been left for nature to reclaim in her own good time - and she had started in earnest.

Their roots grew in, their leaves a bright green over the grey, and the land began to breathe once more, healing the scars o",road
"Amid the infinitely greened hills, the rolling verdant hues that flow into gold, is the road.

So long as I move onward, travel over any rough ground, the end of that road, and the country that is its company a long the way, is ever more brilliant.",road
"The road stretches onward, hugging the land, taking each turn in easy stride. It is a grey that has welcomed many suns, become silvery as it soaked in the rays. I let my eyes run over each hue, seeing imperfections for the first time, yet feeling that as details created by an artistic hand, they render it all the more beautiful.",road
"The road is midnight under the cloud, yet beyond is the dawn. As the sun sets, its rising is already promised to the land, to the green shoots who wait in faith.

It was as if life herself had entered the water and the energy was so great that this great pulse came upward to form a steady rhythm.",sea
"Moving through her depths, I become aware of her currents; the sea is more as rivers in three dimensions with no need of banks. In them are schools of the living, the creation that remained in her watery embrace when we land dwellers sought flowers and the shelter of trees. Though to her fish swimming is as easy as breathing underwater, it is no doubt time for me to return to the waves and the boat that awaits, anchored for my return as it rests upon her steady pulse.",sea
Never was their a picture as enchanting as the ever-evolving sea.,sea
"The sea is more than we see, for she gives us most of the oxygen in our lungs. she wraps her brine around every limb as a mother, only ever asking for our respect and loving care.",sea
"The sea is infinite blue in infinite weather patterns, yet in all this she is the prettiest colour I ever saw.",sea
"This deep in the sea, even through my second skin, I can feel the temperature of the water drop. It isn't like a winter chill, bringing a shiver to the skin, but more like the welcome coolness of an autumn breeze. I can never get enough of these pure waters or the way everything is cast blue by the filtered light. ",sea
